## Project pitch:

We are creating a database for food delivery that allows a user on the front end to send a request for a dish to a given restaurant and delivery service.

## User story: 

As a user, I am given ~3 delivery services to choose from. I can then view restaurants that are provided from a given service, and select a dish of choice to be delivered. I will then be given a delivery status with an estimated time of arrival.
